        Hello, I'm Bruck!
👨‍💻 I'm a passionate Vue + Laravel developer with over 3 years of professional experience.

🎓 I hold a Bachelor's degree in software engineering, which has equipped me with a solid foundation in developing robust and scalable web applications.

💼 Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, ranging from small-scale applications to large enterprise solutions. My expertise lies in building modern, user-friendly interfaces using Vue.js, and creating powerful backend systems with Laravel.

⚙️ I have a deep understanding of the Vue.js framework and its ecosystem, including Vuex for state management, Vue Router for navigation, and Vue CLI for efficient project setup. I leverage Laravel's elegant syntax, powerful ORM, and extensive ecosystem to develop RESTful APIs, handle authentication, and perform complex database operations.

🚀 I'm passionate about delivering high-quality code and ensuring optimal performance and scalability. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and finding innovative solutions, always striving to stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends and best practices.

🌟 Some of the projects I've worked on include SaaS for Restaurant Management,Online Long-term Internship Management, and Online Job Marketplace in Ethiopia where I contributed to Design, Development and Maintainance of these projects.

📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or continuously learning and enhancing my skills.
