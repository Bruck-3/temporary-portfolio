          Hey There!My name is Bruck, I am a Full Stack Web developer with 3+ years of experience using Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Laravel, and more. I have worked on several projects including a SaaS for a restaurant management web app that specializes in food Accounting and tax services, a full online long-term internship management web application, and an online Job marketplace that has become the largest in users in Ethiopia. </p>
        <p>  With my work, I like to apply designs as accurately as represented and I take pride in that fact. I have worked on making websites responsive using the grid system. I have used Vuetify and TailwindCSS as CSS and material frameworks. I have a good knowledge of vanilla Javascript(ES6+) as well as Vue, The Vue Router, and VueX state management. I have experience integrating front-end applications with APIs. I used both package managers npm and yarn in previous projects and have git experience using Github and Bitbucket.</p>
         <p> I enjoy working with colleagues and team members and am very open to learning new things and new methods of making something work. I have a year of experience working as a remote developer for a company based in Japan and I am very comfortable working on projects and managing myself to set deadlines and achieve milestones.
        </p>
